		       <h3>Introduction</h3>
		        <p>computer security, also called cybersecurity, the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. Computer hardware is typically protected by the same means used to protect other valuable or sensitive equipment—namely, serial numbers, doors and locks, and alarms. The protection of information and system access, on the other hand, is achieved through other tactics, some of them quite complex.</p>

		       <h3>What is Cyber Security</h3>
		       <p>Cyberspace can be defined as an electronic medium of computer networks in which online communications take place. This space is a mammoth network of hundreds of thousands of networked computers, servers holding massive amounts of data, routers, modems, and switches. These are in turn connected through tens of thousands of powerful optical fiber cables both on land and across the seas, called submarine cables. So keeping these networks, individually and collectively, is everyone’s responsibility.</p>
		       <p>Now keeping this network safe for individuals, organizations and governments have become a huge business requiring huge amounts of resources in manpower and infrastructure. This Cybersecurity has fast become an interesting and rewarding field for the students to concentrate on.</p>

		       <h3>Concepts</h3>
		       <p>The increasing Cyber threats imply that individuals, small businesses, large organizations, and government agencies are increasingly concentrating on securing their systems against all forms of cyber threats. In layman terms, Cybersecurity is the act of protecting standalone computers, a network of interconnected computers, individual, organizational, and highly sensitive government and national security data from damaging Cyber attacks. This process involves adopting a variety of Cybersecurity concepts to suit the needs of the users.</p>
		       <p>For a beginner, the Cyber Security basics and concepts include knowing about keeping safe from email scams, malware, virus, wi-fi security, financial scams, phishing scams, safe use of internet tools like social media, and more. Even smartphones are increasingly becoming an integral part of our daily lives and need some basic protection. Beginners have to understand some basic concepts of Cybersecurity and subscribe to anti-virus software for personal computers and networks in small businesses to protect themselves.</p>

		       <h3>Key Areas</h3>
		       <p>The key areas of Cybersecurity known as the CIA triad comprise of confidentiality, information, and availability.</p>
		       <p>Information is the key to everything. The confidentiality of information related to an organization is integral to all this. Each person needs access to a certain type and level of information only and this amount of information accessible increases as one goes up the organizational ladder. Each person is trained appropriately to protect and maintain the confidentiality of all information available to him through a password and other security tools. The overall organizational Cybersecurity is taken care of by a dedicated department through an appropriate firewall.</p>
